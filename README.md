# Challange_Hackaton
## Changes Made

### Added Person class:
- Created a `Person` class with the required fields.

### Improved prompts:
- Made the prompts more user-friendly and grammatically correct.

### Variable renaming:
- Renamed `nomber` to `number` and `tall` to `height` for clarity.

### Validation (optional):
- You might want to add validation to ensure inputs are within reasonable ranges.

### Resource management:
- Closed the `Scanner` object at the end of the program.

## Example Input/Output

Enter the age of person 2: 30
Enter the height (in cm) of person 2: 175.0
